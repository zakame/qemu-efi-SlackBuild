qemu-efi (UEFI firmware for 64-bit ARM virtual machines)
--------------------------------------------------------

(Adapted from Pat Volkerding's Google Chrome SlackBuild.)

Here's how to install qemu-efi on Slackware.


First, go to the Debian Packages page for qemu-efi:

https://packages.debian.org/stretch/qemu-efi

Download the .deb package.


Then, with the .deb package in the same directory as the
qemu-efi.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to convert the .deb
to a Slackware .txz:

./qemu-efi.SlackBuild

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of qemu-efi found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like:  qemu-efi-0~20161202.7bbe0b3e-noarch-1.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new qemu-efi-0~20161202.7bbe0b3e-noarch-1.txz


Enjoy!  :-)
